# Power Platform Samples

This repository contains community samples that demonstrate different usage patterns for the Microsoft Power Platform.

## Sample migration

We are currently in the process of moving all the per product samples into solutions, so that they can be used more easily. The following repositories will still exist for the time being but will be removed later on when all samples are migrated to this repository.

- [Power Fx Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerfx-samples)
- [Power Apps Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerapps-samples)
- [Power Automate Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerautomate-samples)
- [Power Virtual Agents Samples](https://github.com/pnp/powerva-samples)

> You're welcome to bring samples from the other repositories! The more people help, the faster we'll move all the samples here.
