# Archived samples from MSDN Code Gallery

The samples under this folder are older samples that are copied over from MSDN Code Gallery, which is [retired now.](https://docs.microsoft.com/teamblog/msdn-code-gallery-retired). The samples apply to the Customer Engagement (on-premises), Common Data Service, and model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

We are actively working to convert these samples to the latest format, will move it to one of the following places:
- Under the respective app folder in this repo (if it applies to an app). 
- To the cds folder (<https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/cds/orgsvc/C%23>) in the PowerApps samples repo (if it applies to the platform).
