This sample shows how to create a connection between an account and a contact that have matching connection roles.

## How to run this sample

See [How to run samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/blob/master/sales/README.md) for information about how to run this sample.

## What this sample does

This sample shows how to create a connection between two entities.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

- Creates data that this sample requires.
- Creates related Connection Role Object Type Code records for the account and the contact entities.
- Deletes any entity records that were created for this sample. The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
