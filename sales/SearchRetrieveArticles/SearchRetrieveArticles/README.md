This sample shows how to search by body, keyword, and title, and retrieve articles by topic incident subject and topic incident product.

## How to run this sample

See [How to run samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/blob/master/sales/README.md) for information about how to run this sample.

## What this sample does

This sample first creates sample articles and publishes them, then searches for the articles by body, keyword and title. Finally, it retrieves the articles by top incident subject and top incident product.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

- create kb articles
- Submit the articles
- Approve and Publish the article
- Search Knowledge base by Body
- Search knowledge base by Keyword
- Search knowledge base by Title
- Retrieve by top incident subject
- Retrieve by top incident product
- Delete incidents, accounts and units of measure. The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.
