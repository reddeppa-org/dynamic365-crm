This sample shows how to set negative prices in opportunities, quotes, and sales orders.

## How to run this sample

See [How to run samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics365-Apps-Samples/blob/master/sales/README.md) for information about how to run this sample.

## What this sample does

The sample creates an opportunity to demonstrate a negative estimated value. This is followed by the creation of a quote with a negative product quantity. Finally, a sales order with a negative product price is shown.

## How this sample works

In order to simulate the scenario described in [What this sample does](#what-this-sample-does), the sample will do the following:

- Create or Retrieve the necessary system users
- Create records to support Opportunity records
- Opportunity with negative estimated value.
- Quote with negative quantity.
- Sales Order with negative price.
- Delete records. The deletion is optional in case you want to examine the entities and data created by the sample. You can manually delete the records to achieve the same result.

### Demonstrate

This sample demonstrates how to set negative values for amount and number attributes in opportunities, quotes, sales orders.
