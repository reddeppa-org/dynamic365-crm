# Badger FX

## Summary

This sample app allows you to convert the value of any currency (to be added within the app) and convert an amount, from the selected currency to euros. It was created for the purpose of experimenting with modern controls and managing the data in the phone's local cache (Where the currencies entered are saved), and also because I need it for my next trip :-)
