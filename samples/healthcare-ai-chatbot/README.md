## Features

The PVA chatbot lets the user input their current symptoms to let the Chatbot diagnose the user via generative answers located in the of the chatbot's topic.

After that, the chatbot displays an adaptive card asking for a specific date & time

From there, a Power Automate flow in the same topic uses AI to check the user's symptoms for any key words/phrases, then uses that to determine which doctor is the best fit for them based on their specialization. It also checks whether the doctor wil lbe available based on the user's selected date & time on the previous step.

There are also 2 alternate topics in the chatbot: 
* One for directly setting up a consultation with a specific doctor by specifying the requested doctor and date & time of the appointment
