# Forem

## Summary

This sample shows how you can use the Forem (Independent Publisher) connector. In this case it shows the latest posts, posts about Azure and posts about .NET. In this example I used DevTo as the Forem instance. The sample also uses the Creator Kit - so make sure to install that before importing this sample!

* Pack the source files back into a solution `.zip` file:

  ```bash
  pac solution pack --zipfile pathtodestinationfile --folder pathtosourcefolder --processCanvasApps
  ```

  Making sure to replace `pathtosourcefolder` to point to the path to this sample's `sourcecode` folder, and `pathtodestinationfile` to point to the path of this solution's `.zip` file (located under the `solution` folder)
* Within **Power Apps Studio**, import the solution `.zip` file using **Solutions** > **Import Solution** and select the `.zip` file you just packed.
